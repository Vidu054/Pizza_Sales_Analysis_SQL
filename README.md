## Problem Statement 

1. Identify trends and patterns in pizza sales, including popular pizza, customer preference, Size and peak ordering times.

2. Provide actionable insights.

### KPI Requirement
We need to analyse key indicators for our Pizza sales data to gain insight into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metric:

1. **Total Revenue:** The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizza Sold:** The sum of the quantities of pizza sold
4. **Total Orders:** Total number of orders placed by the customers.
5. **Average Pizza Per Order:** The average no of pizzas that are ordered in each transaction, is calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

I will also try to answer below question

1. During which days and times do we experience the highest activity levels?
2. How many pizzas are produced during peak periods?
3. Which pizzas are our top sellers and which ones perform poorly?
4. What is the average revenue generated?
5. How does our order performance vary every month?
6. What is the performance of different pizza sizes in terms of orders?
7. Which pizza category is the most popular among customers?
8. How does our monthly revenue performance compare?

The revenue generated in 2015 was substantial, indicating a healthy financial performance for the year. Customers tended to spend a moderate amount per order, suggesting that the pricing strategy may be effective in balancing affordability and profitability. The high volume of pizza sales indicates a strong demand for the product, highlighting its popularity among customers. The significant number of orders demonstrates a steady flow of business throughout the period.  On average, customers tended to order more than two pizzas per transaction, indicating a preference for multiple items per order. Fridays emerged as the busiest day for pizza orders, while Sundays experienced lower demand, possibly due to weekend relaxation or dining out. The popularity of the Classic Deluxe Pizza suggests that it resonates well with customers, while the lower demand for the Brie Carre Pizza may indicate a niche or less favored option. The revenue generated by each pizza variant varies, with some pizzas contributing more significantly to overall revenue than others. Insight: Despite the popularity of Chicken pizzas in terms of the quantity ordered, Classic pizzas generated the highest revenue, highlighting the importance of considering both sales volume and revenue generation in assessing product performance.
